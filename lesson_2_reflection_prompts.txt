What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    No commit is created (since you have to give it a message yourself) but you
    create a .git folder which will contains the commits of the different files
    you want to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area contains the files that you think are almost ready to be
    committed (they are added to that area once you use 'add <file_name>'). The
    working directory is the directory you are working, the files can be
    different from the staging area or the repository. The repository contains
    the last committed files (the last version).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
